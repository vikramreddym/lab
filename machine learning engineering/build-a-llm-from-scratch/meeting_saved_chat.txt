09:08:24 From jcrg to Everyone:

09:09:11 From Aditya to Everyone:
	Because it is trained on internet scale data (in the range of trillions of tokens). Secondly the model itself is very huge (billions of parameters used).
09:09:19 From natethegreat to Everyone:
	just curious how openai team or meta team do their data cleaning
09:09:19 From Hegemon to Everyone:
	And improvements in training techniques
09:09:39 From Hreetam Paul to Everyone:
	wont fine tuning also consist of prompt engineering?
09:09:50 From natethegreat to Everyone:
	because in the book, the author talks abouts tokenization and BPE, etc.
09:09:53 From Hegemon to Everyone:
	Prompt Engineering is an inference technique. Supervised Fine-tuning is the next-step after Pretraining

	They are professional data preparations pipelines. 
	https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/ 
	
	There are also conjectures most companies have overlap in their source of training data and hence you see similar behaviour across llms for similar prompts.
09:16:18 From natethegreat to Everyone:
	I think we can just maintain the codebase on our own. But if there's something interesting or wanted to build anything cool opensource based off the book or others, we can open source it everyone

	Bert has a smaller footprint, so it can be very good for classification if you fine-tune it
09:29:32 From Naveen to Everyone:
	Which page/ section is this directionality aspect covered? am a bit lost :)
09:29:32 From Matorrixo to Everyone:
	So for each token generation, you look at all the current words. Thus the embeddings of the each token are changing a bit as we generate the text.
09:30:01 From Andres Castillo to Everyone:
	I'm confused because my understanding is that in the GPT arch the objective is to predict the next word whereas in BERT is to "fill in the middle",so can BERT be used for task like generate text or just classify it?
09:31:35 From Hegemon to Everyone:
	Replying to "I'm confused because..." 
	
	 BERT isn't so suitable for generating text
09:31:47 From Hreetam Paul to Everyone:
	to put it simply BERT is like some1 who understand the behind the scene stuff like sentiment and others are self explanatory apart from generating anything
09:32:06 From Robin to Everyone:
	Replying to "I'm confused because..." 
	
	 I also think by it filling the gap their is some aspects of generation (generating the gaps next posible word )
09:32:29 From Hegemon to Everyone:
	Replying to "Which page/ section ..." 
	
	 It isn't. Maybe a bit.
09:32:30 From Aditya to Everyone:
	Oh, I thought that once we generate the nth token, only the nth token is fed back to generate the n+1 th token. This means the other token embeddings won’t change right.

	BERT B is bidirectional, the input is provided twice, from left to right, and from right to left

	Thanks that cleared it up
09:36:05 From Aditya to Everyone:
	Replying to "I think the biggest ..."

	not sure if I ought to wait for the end of the presentation, but I am interested in how are you able to asses how big in terms of number of parameters do you have to build the model if you want to use it with one vertical - say programming in C? I would assume that there ought to be a connection between the parameter number and the size of the dataset. Going further, for the interaction, one would probably use existing llama3.1 weights probably and build on that. How does one go about it?

	3B1B	this is a good visual which provides decent intro. But if you look at the code in the book. I had a lot of questions relating t the linear alg function calls and the parameters used. These are basically math questions.

	natethegreat888, this is me on discord. 		however, I would check with santi for a study group on math. 		I think this is very important. 		If a meeting session is required for math, I will set up one if necessary based on feedback from the group. 		But yeah, let's utilize santi's group. 		I want to start this to keep myself motivated. :)
